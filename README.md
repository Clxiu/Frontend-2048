# Front-end Phase 3

Welcome to Phase 3! Congratulations for making it so far. For Phase 3, the requirement is to implement some more advanced features that are a bit more involved or difficult to get working.

## Front End Requirements

To pass phase 3 for the front-end, you will need to have any __five__ of the following advanced features, or any __two__ of the extra for experts features.

## Advanced Features List

* Usage of SSR / SSG with at least __three__ of the advanced features
* Usage of Terraform to structure and provision a cloud environment, which is incorporated into a CI/CD pipeline

## Example Repository

The following front-end code is meant to be a reference, as to how you could implement some of these advanced features. This assignment is going to be tough, and we're sure you're going to have a lot of questions. Please ask them over on the discord server, where we will respond ASAP!
